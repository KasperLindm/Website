                Skelnet SDL Networking
                </h3>
                This was a small group group-project that I and two other programmers made. Our focus was on networking the game and we are happy with what we accomplished in 4 weeks.
                
                <br><br>
                
                It was really fun to work with this project because the team was small and we worked closely together with things we wanted to do and improve. During the project I got to practice alot of structure, teamwork, networking and more!
                                <br><br>

               I mostly worked with the networking, audio, particle-system but we worked toghether alot to solve the problems we faced as a group (such as restructiuring the packet-system).
