                <h3>Nim</h3>
                Nim is a game set in the tree-tops of a mystical forest. the 3d platformer was a group project i was apart of at Future-Games,<br>I made the character controller for the player. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                The biggest lesson i got from this project was working in such a big team and working with agile. It was really fun as it was my first project working with so many talented people.
