                Asteroids SDL Engine
                </h3>
                This was a small asignment i got from my mentor. It was the second engine i've made and this time tried to focus on structuring the game components in an effective way.
                
                <br><br>
                
                The most important lesson i got from this project was the need for planning and structuring code. Calculating the collisions were the biggest roadblock that i redesigned twice.
