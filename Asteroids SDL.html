                Asteroids SDL Engine
                </h3>
                This was a small assignment I got from my mentor. It is the second engine i've made and this time I tried to focus on structuring the game components in an effective way.

                The most important lesson I got from this project was the need for planning and structuring code. Calculating the collisions were the biggest roadblock that I redesigned twice and some planning was required.
